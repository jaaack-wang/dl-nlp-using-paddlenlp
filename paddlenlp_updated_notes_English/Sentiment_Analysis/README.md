## Description

Sentiment analysis is one of the classic text classification tasks in NLP, although most of the time it refers to sentence-level sentiment analysis (judging whether a sentence contains a positive or negative sentiment no matter who holds etc.). More about text classification can be found out in my new repository [text-classification-explained](https://github.com/jaaack-wang/text-classification-explained) (also including building and training models with Pytorch and TensorFlow).

More detailed explanations on the five or three (broadly) neural models are coming soon. Will also introduce the SKEP (Sentiment Knowledge Enhanced Pretrained) model later on.

Basic model architecture for the four models  can be seen below:
